EXPECTIMAX

observations 

used only depth limited search --- getting 361 for ai and 100 for RA
( depth = 3 ) (did depth = 4 , ai = 379 , RA = 101(seems to be 
more focussed to increase its score rather than decreasing the other's score ) ... taking
about 3-4 secs per move) for timebound ... keep updating best move ... maybe ... but seems to finish all the popout moves ..... 

for n, m = 12 .... it takes 15 -17 secs per move ....for depth = 4 some cases time limit exceeded :(  ) ... need to do better ... go till atleast 5 or best case 6 



improvemnts to make -- 

1)use depth limited search 

2)use a better heuristic function 

3)use expecimax pruning 

4)Recheck code for any possible bug that is decreasing efficiency .. unlikely but still check it 

5) Can work with depth of 4 ti
